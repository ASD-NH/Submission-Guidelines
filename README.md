# Submission Guidelines

Hi! Welcome to the ASD organization! We would love to have your project featured here, just a few things first:

- Projects need to be created only by ASD students or previous ASD students
- Projects need to not infringe on any copyrights or violate any terms of service
- Projects should be at least semi-functional. Don't add completely unfinished code to the organization

Thats about it! If you want to add a project in its current state to the organization while maintaining full ownership of it, you can just fork it into the organization. Make sure to add a description mentioning what the project is and who worked on it, and a note in the README if what the project is is unclear. If you'd like to move a project to the organization (you can still contribute to it afterwards), you can also do that.

If you'd like to contribute to community projects, such as the TI-BASIC program repository, or the website, just contact any of the admins using our ASD (firstname.lastname@asdnh.org) accounts and we'll give you push access. We'd love your help.

Thanks, and enjoy!
