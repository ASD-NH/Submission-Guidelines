# Submission Guidelines

Hi! Welcome to the ASD organization! We would love to have your project featured here, just a few things first:

- Projects need to be created only by ASD students or previous ASD students
- Projects need to not infringe on any copyrights or violate any terms of service
- Projects should be at least semi-functional. Don't add completely unfinished code to the organization

Thats about it! If you want to add a project in its current state to the organization while maintaining full ownership of it, you can just fork it into the organization. Make sure to add a description mentioning what the project is and who worked on it, and a note in the README if what the project is is unclear. If you'd like to move a project to the organization (you can still contribute to it afterwards), you can also do that.

If you'd like to contribute to community projects, such as the TI-BASIC program repository, the Project Euler repository, or the website, either contact any of the admins using our ASD (firstname.lastname@asdnh.org) accounts for push access, or just pull request and it will be approved as soon as possible. To find out who the admins are, please look at the [People Page](https://github.com/orgs/ASD-NH/people) for the organization. Also feel free to pull request any other projects on the organization, and if the owner likes your changes, they may approve them! We'd all love your help.

Thanks, and enjoy!
